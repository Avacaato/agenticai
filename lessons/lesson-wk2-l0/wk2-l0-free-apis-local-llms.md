# Getting Ready: Free LLM Options for This Course

In this course, you‚Äôll be using tools like **LangChain** and **LangGraph** to build intelligent, goal-driven AI systems. Many lessons include examples that use OpenAI‚Äôs API ‚Äî a popular option, but one that typically requires a paid subscription.

**Good news:** you can complete this course **without needing to pay for API access**.

We‚Äôve intentionally designed the curriculum with **low usage requirements**, so learners can follow along without hitting paywalls. All major projects and hands-on lessons can be completed using **free-tier API keys** or **local models** that run entirely on your machine.

In this lesson, you‚Äôll learn about two ways to get started without spending anything:

1.  **Use Free API Access**
    Providers like **Groq** and **Google Gemini** offer generous free usage quotas for high-quality LLMs. Some of these even support OpenAI models, so you can stick with familiar prompts while avoiding upfront costs.

2.  **Run Local Models with Ollama**
    If you have a machine with a decent GPU, you can use **Ollama** to download and run open-source models like **Llama 3**, **Mistral**, or **Code Llama** right on your computer. This option gives you full control and zero API limits ‚Äî perfect for hands-on learners who want to explore under the hood.

We‚Äôll walk you through how to set up each of these options and explain the tradeoffs ‚Äî from speed and quality to installation complexity and system requirements.

:::info{title="Effortless LLM Switching With LangChain"}

LangChain makes switching between providers seamless, whether you're using Groq, Gemini, OpenAI, or a local model with Ollama. With just a small config change, you can follow the course without rewriting your code or adjusting your prompts ‚Äî giving you the freedom to choose what works best for you.

# Option 1: Use a Free Cloud API

You don‚Äôt need to run large language models on your own machine to follow this course. Providers like **Groq** and **Google Gemini** offer **free API access** to high-quality models ‚Äî no credit card or subscription required.

These cloud APIs are:

- Easy to set up
- Well-supported by LangChain
- Fast enough for real-time use
- Free to use (within generous usage and rate limits)

Let‚Äôs start with Groq.

## Gemini: Access Google‚Äôs LLMs Through a Free Developer Tier

**Gemini** is Google‚Äôs suite of powerful large language models ‚Äî and you can access them via **Gemini API**, using a developer key that you generate through **Google AI Studio**.

You don‚Äôt need to enter payment information to get started. The API offers a **free tier** designed for testing, development, and learning ‚Äî making it a great fit for coursework and experimentation.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Google‚Äôs free tier includes usage limits and rate caps. These are typically generous enough for this course, but they are not meant for production use. If you hit a limit, you can wait for it to reset ‚Äî or upgrade later if needed.

---

# Option 2: Run a Local LLM with Ollama

Don‚Äôt want to depend on cloud APIs at all? **Ollama** lets you run powerful LLMs like **Llama 3**, **Mistral**, and **Code Llama** locally ‚Äî with no API keys, no rate limits, and no internet required once models are downloaded.

This is a great option if:

- You want full control over the models you're using
- You‚Äôre interested in exploring open models
- You have a machine with enough resources (RAM and GPU)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Running local models requires decent hardware ‚Äî especially if you're using larger models. We recommend starting with smaller variants like `llama3:8b` if you‚Äôre unsure.

---

### Advantages of Using Ollama

- ‚úÖ **No API calls or rate limits** ‚Äî everything runs locally
- ‚úÖ **Fully offline** after initial model download
- ‚úÖ **Free and open-source** ‚Äî no subscriptions or tokens needed
- ‚úÖ **Great for privacy-conscious development and experimentation**
- ‚úÖ **LangChain-compatible** with minimal setup

---

### How to Set Up and Use Ollama

 <h4> Step 1: Install Ollama </h4>
 
 Go to [https://ollama.com](https://ollama.com) and download the installer for your system (macOS, Windows, or Linux).
 
 Follow the instructions to complete installation.
 
 ---
 
 <h4> Step 2: Download a Model </h4>
 
 Once installed, open your terminal and run:
 
 ```bash
 # Recommended starting point
 ollama pull llama3:8b
 ```
 
 Other available models include:
 
 ```bash
 ollama pull mistral
 ollama pull codellama
 ```
 
 These will download and prepare the models for local use.
 
 ---
 
 <h4> Step 3: Install the LangChain Integration </h4>
 
 Install the Ollama LangChain wrapper:
 
 ```bash
 pip install langchain-ollama
 ```
 
 ---
 
 <h4> Step 4: Run a Local LLM Test </h4>
 
 Here‚Äôs a minimal example:
 
 ```python
 from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatOllama
 
 llm = ChatOllama(model="llama3:8b")
 response = llm.invoke("Summarize how local models work.")
 print(response)
 ```
 
 This will invoke the LLM running on your machine and return a response ‚Äî no cloud involved.
 
 > üß™ Try a fun test prompt like: `"Explain agentic AI like you're a movie trailer narrator."`

# When to Use Which Option

Not sure which path to pick? Here‚Äôs the good news: **they all work** ‚Äî and you can switch at any time.

If you want something fast and cloud-hosted, start with **Groq** or **Gemini**. Prefer full control or want to work offline? Try **Ollama**. You‚Äôre not locked in ‚Äî LangChain makes it easy to change providers without rewriting your code.

|           | **Groq**           | **Gemini**        | **Ollama**            |
| --------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Setup     | Easy cloud setup   | Easy cloud setup  | Requires install      |
| Speed     | Very fast          | Fast              | Varies by hardware    |
| Cost      | Free tier          | Free tier         | Fully free (local)    |
| Limits    | Rate caps apply    | Rate caps apply   | No rate limits        |
| Offline?  | ‚ùå                 | ‚ùå                | ‚úÖ                    |
| Great for | Prototyping, speed | Reasoning, coding | Privacy, full control |

There‚Äôs no single ‚Äúbest‚Äù choice ‚Äî just pick what fits your system and comfort level. You can always switch later.
