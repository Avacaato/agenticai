# Getting Ready: Free LLM Options for This Course

In this course, you‚Äôll be using tools like **LangChain** and **LangGraph** to build intelligent, goal-driven AI systems. Many lessons include examples that use OpenAI‚Äôs API ‚Äî a popular option, but one that typically requires a paid subscription.

**Good news:** you can complete this course **without needing to pay for API access**.

We‚Äôve intentionally designed the curriculum with **low usage requirements**, so learners can follow along without hitting paywalls. All major projects and hands-on lessons can be completed using **free-tier API keys** or **local models** that run entirely on your machine.

In this lesson, you‚Äôll learn about two ways to get started without spending anything:

1.  **Use Free API Access**
    Providers like **Groq** and **Google Gemini** offer generous free usage quotas for high-quality LLMs. Some of these even support OpenAI models, so you can stick with familiar prompts while avoiding upfront costs.

2.  **Run Local Models with Ollama**
    If you have a machine with a decent GPU, you can use **Ollama** to download and run open-source models like **Llama 3**, **Mistral**, or **Code Llama** right on your computer. This option gives you full control and zero API limits ‚Äî perfect for hands-on learners who want to explore under the hood.

We‚Äôll walk you through how to set up each of these options and explain the tradeoffs ‚Äî from speed and quality to installation complexity and system requirements.

# Option 2: Run a Local LLM with Ollama

Don‚Äôt want to depend on cloud APIs at all? **Ollama** lets you run powerful LLMs like **Llama 3**, **Mistral**, and **Code Llama** locally ‚Äî with no API keys, no rate limits, and no internet required once models are downloaded.

This is a great option if:

- You want full control over the models you're using
- You‚Äôre interested in exploring open models
- You have a machine with enough resources (RAM and GPU)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Running local models requires decent hardware ‚Äî especially if you're using larger models. We recommend starting with smaller variants like `llama3:8b` if you‚Äôre unsure.

---

### Advantages of Using Ollama

- ‚úÖ **No API calls or rate limits** ‚Äî everything runs locally
- ‚úÖ **Fully offline** after initial model download
- ‚úÖ **Free and open-source** ‚Äî no subscriptions or tokens needed
- ‚úÖ **Great for privacy-conscious development and experimentation**
- ‚úÖ **LangChain-compatible** with minimal setup

---

### How to Set Up and Use Ollama

 <h4> Step 1: Install Ollama </h4>
 
 Go to [https://ollama.com](https://ollama.com) and download the installer for your system (macOS, Windows, or Linux).
 
 Follow the instructions to complete installation.
 
 ---
 
 <h4> Step 2: Download a Model </h4>
 
 Once installed, open your terminal and run:
 
 ```bash
 # Recommended starting point
 ollama pull llama3:8b
 ```
 
 Other available models include:
 
 ```bash
 ollama pull mistral
 ollama pull codellama
 ```
 
 These will download and prepare the models for local use.
 
 ---
 
 <h4> Step 3: Install the LangChain Integration </h4>
 
 Install the Ollama LangChain wrapper:
 
 ```bash
 pip install langchain-ollama
 ```
 
 ---
 
 <h4> Step 4: Run a Local LLM Test </h4>
 
 Here‚Äôs a minimal example:
 
 ```python
 from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatOllama
 
 llm = ChatOllama(model="llama3:8b")
 response = llm.invoke("Summarize how local models work.")
 print(response)
 ```
 
 This will invoke the LLM running on your machine and return a response ‚Äî no cloud involved.

<h4> How to Estimate the Total Memory Needed for a Model </h4>

The total GPU memory required to run a model is the sum of:

$$
\text{Total Memory} \approx \text{Model Weights Size} + \text{Activation Size}
$$
---

1. Model Weights Size

This is the memory needed to store the model‚Äôs parameters.
$$
\text{weights\_size\_bytes} = \text{num\_parameters} \times \text{bytes\_per\_parameter}
$$

- num_parameters: Total number of parameters (e.g., 1B, 7B, 20B).
- bytes_per_parameter: Depends on precision (FP32 = 4 bytes, FP16 = 2 bytes, Q8 = 1 byte, Q4 = 0.5 byte).

---

2. Activation Size

Activations are the intermediate outputs stored during the forward pass.

$$ \text{activation\_size\_bytes} \approx \text{num\_layers} \times \text{batch\_size} \times \text{seq\_length} \times \text{hidden\_size} \times \text{bytes\_per\_parameter} $$

- num_layers: Number of transformer layers.
- batch_size: Number of sequences processed at once.
- seq_length: Number of tokens in each sequence.
- hidden_size: Size of the hidden vector in each layer.

---

3. Quantization Factor

Quantization reduces the memory needed for weights by storing parameters in fewer bits.

Adjusted formula for weights with quantization:
$$ \text{weights\_size\_bytes} = \frac{\text{num\_parameters}}{\text{quantization\_factor}} \times \text{bytes\_per\_parameter} $$

- Quantization factor:
- FP32 ‚Üí 1 (no reduction)
- Q8 ‚Üí 2 (50% smaller than FP16, 75% smaller than FP32)
- Q4 ‚Üí 4 (75% smaller than FP16, 87.5% smaller than FP32)

---

Example: 1B Model

Assume:
- Parameters = 1B
- Precision = FP32 (4 bytes)
- Batch size = 8
- Sequence length = 512
- Hidden size = 1024
- Layers = 24

Weights:
$$1,000,000,000 \times 4 = 4,000,000,000\ \text{bytes} \approx 4\ \text{GB}$$

Activations:
$$24 \times 8 \times 512 \times 1024 \times 4 \approx 384\ \text{MB}$$

Total:
$$4\ \text{GB} + 0.384\ \text{GB} \approx 4.38\ \text{GB}$$

# When to Use Which Option

Not sure which path to pick? Here‚Äôs the good news: **they all work** ‚Äî and you can switch at any time.

If you want something fast and cloud-hosted, start with **Groq** or **Gemini**. Prefer full control or want to work offline? Try **Ollama**. You‚Äôre not locked in ‚Äî LangChain makes it easy to change providers without rewriting your code.

|           | **Groq**           | **Gemini**        | **Ollama**            |
| --------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | --------------------- |

# OpenAI's GPT-OSS Models: Now Available for Local Use

OpenAI recently released open-source versions of their models, known as **GPT-OSS**. These include two models like **gpt-oss-20b** and **gpt-oss-120b** that you can now run locally using Ollama.

**What makes GPT-OSS special:**
- **Fully open-weight** - you can download and modify them freely
- **High performance** - built on OpenAI's latest architecture
- **Local deployment** - run them on your own hardware with Ollama

**Using GPT-OSS with Ollama:**
```bash
# Download the 20B model (requires ~16GB RAM)
ollama pull gpt-oss:20b

# Or the larger 120B model (requires ~60GB RAM)
ollama pull gpt-oss:120b
```

**Reality check:** While these models offer cutting-edge capabilities, they require substantial hardware resources that are likely beyond most learning setups. The 20B model needs around 16GB of RAM, and the 120B model needs approximately 60GB - making cloud APIs more practical for most users in this course.

However, if you have access to high-end workstations or servers, these models represent an exciting opportunity to run OpenAI-quality models completely locally and privately.
